## Favorite CSPC 120 L Labs 
Lab 6 Part-1 

This was an elementary lab but I enjoyed the task we were given, which was filling in the blank for a sandwich. The task itself was not difficult looking back and even back when I worked on it but it was very cool to work with vectors I would like also to add my lab partner was also a pleasure to work with since I appreciated the back and forth we went to figure out how to this program efficiently.

Lab 4 Part-1 

Working with separate files was an interesting challenge when doing this lab I was at first puzzled on how certain things would work but after a bit of trial and error, I got the hang of things. Working with conversion rates was also helpful for me since I could go back and do the math myself if there was a logic error in my conversions.


Lab 8 Part-2 

The problem that was given to me was interesting it was something that I haven't dealt with in lab which is to create a pattern using several loops. When I dealt with nested for loops it was confusing at first since it didn't click in my head how it worked but once one of my partners explained how it worked I understood.I thought the pattern that we had to work towards also looked pretty cool it was a challenging problem at first but I enjoyed working on it.
